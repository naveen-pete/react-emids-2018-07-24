Const and Let
-------------
* ES6 Enhancements - falls under 2 categories

1. Syntactic sugar - stuff to help you write less code
   - code is more expressive and cleaner
   
2. New ideas, constructs or functionalities to the language


The following code uses 'var' instead of 'const' and 'let'. Refactor the function to use the new keywords.  Be sure to consider whether the variable should be declared using 'const' or 'let' depending on whether the variable gets reassigned or not.
var statuses = [ 
  { code: 'OK', response: 'Request successful' },
  { code: 'FAILED', response: 'There was an error with your request' },
  { code: 'PENDING', response: 'Your reqeust is still pending' }
];
var message = '';
var currentCode = 'OK';

for (var i = 0; i < statuses.length; i++) {
  if (statuses[i].code === currentCode) {
    message = statuses[i].response;
  }
}
